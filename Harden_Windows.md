### **🛡️ Windows Server Hardening: Basics and Advanced 🚀**

Here are the **basic** and **advanced** hardening rules and processes for securing your Windows Server environment! 🖥️🔒

---

## **🔑 Basic Windows Server Hardening**

### 1. **⚙️ Initial Setup and Configuration**
- ✅ **Install Latest Updates:** Regularly apply all Windows updates and patches. 📥  
- 🔒 **Rename Administrator Account:** Change the default "Administrator" account to a non-obvious name to prevent brute-force attacks. 🕵️‍♂️  
- 🚫 **Disable Guest Account:** Ensure the guest account is turned off.

### 2. **👤 User and Access Management**
- 🔐 **Use Strong Passwords:** Enforce policies with complexity, length, and expiration.  
- ⚖️ **Least Privilege Principle:** Assign only necessary permissions to users/groups.  
- 🚨 **Account Lockout Policy:** Set up account lockouts after failed login attempts.

### 3. **🌐 Network Security**
- 🧱 **Enable Windows Firewall:** Block unused ports and allow only necessary traffic.  
- ❌ **Disable SMBv1:** Turn off outdated protocols to reduce vulnerabilities.  
- 🔒 **Secure RDP:** Limit RDP access to specific IPs and enable Network Level Authentication (NLA).  

### 4. **📁 File and Directory Security**
- 🔒 **NTFS Permissions:** Restrict access to sensitive files/folders.  
- 👀 **Audit Access:** Monitor sensitive file access with auditing.  

### 5. **🔧 Services and Roles**
- ❌ **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Turn off services unrelated to the server’s role.  
- 🚪 **Role Separation:** Assign specific roles (e.g., DNS, file server).  

### 6. **📊 Logging and Monitoring**
- 📂 **Enable Logging:** Use Event Viewer to track security events.  
- 🔗 **Forward Logs:** Set up centralized logging with tools like Windows Event Collector.

## **🚀 Advanced Windows Server Hardening**

### 1. **🔒 Advanced Authentication**
- 🌟 **MFA:** Require Multi-Factor Authentication for all admin and remote access.  
- 🛡️ **Kerberos:** Use Kerberos authentication over NTLM.  

### 2. **🌐 Advanced Network Security**
- 🔍 **Network Access Control (NAC):** Manage devices accessing the network.  
- 🔑 **IPsec Policies:** Encrypt server communications with IPsec.  
- 🌐 **DNS Security (DNSSEC):** Secure DNS queries against spoofing.  

### 3. **📜 Group Policy Settings**
- 🚫 **Restrict Local Accounts:** Disable remote access for local accounts.  
- 🛡️ **Harden Security Policies:** Configure user rights and audit settings.  
- ✅ **Application Control:** Use AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control.  

### 4. **🔄 Advanced Patch Management**
- 🤖 **Automate Patching:** Manage updates with WSUS or third-party tools.  
- ⚡ **Zero-Day Protection:** Apply hotfixes quickly for emerging vulnerabilities.  

### 5. **🔐 Server and Data Encryption**
- 🔒 **Enable BitLocker:** Protect physical data with drive encryption.  
- 🌐 **Enforce Strong SSL/TLS:** Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 for secure communications.  

### 6. **👀 Advanced Monitoring and Threat Detection**
- 📈 **Use SIEM:** Integrate tools like Splunk or Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection.  
- 🚨 **Advanced Audit Policies:** Enable detailed auditing for sensitive actions.  
- 🛡️ **HIDS:** Deploy OSSEC or Windows Defender ATP for intrusion detection.  

### 7. **☁️ Virtualization and Cloud Security**
- 🔒 **Secure Hyper-V:** Restrict admin access and isolate networks.  
- 🌐 **Cloud Integration Security:** Use Azure Security Center for hybrid setups.  

### 8. **💻 PowerShell Security**
- 🚫 **Constrained Language Mode:** Prevent misuse of PowerShell scripts.  
- ✍️ **Script Signing:** Require all scripts to be digitally signed.
